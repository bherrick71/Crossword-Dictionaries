# Crossword-Dictionaries
Topical .dict files for creating crossword puzzles with CrossFire. Words are prioritized (value = 80) so they will take precedence when using multiple dictionaries.

These files make it easier to flavor your crossword with a certain theme. The themed words will show up at the top of your sort when you're doing a fill. Contributions welcome! Future topics ideas: music, naughty, food & drink.

CrossFire is cross-platform and can be downloaded here: http://beekeeperlabs.com/crossfire/
The $50 license removes the one hour time limit.

To use, go to the CrossFire preferences, click the Dictionary tab, and add the .dict file(s).
